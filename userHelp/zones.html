                <h1>Zone-based maps</h1>
                <p>This part of the program is used to produce zone-based maps with the results of a TRANUS model. The only way to be here is to specify in the previous window a valid shapefile with polygons representing the zones in the model. The user is responsible for a perfect match between the zones in the model and those in the shapefile. If, however, there is a zone in the model that is not in the shapefile, they will simply not appear in the maps. This may be useful for special zones, like external zones that you don't want to include in your maps.</p>
                <p>In this manual we are using the model of Swindon as an example. This model and all related data may be downloaded from:</p>
                <a href="http://www.tranus.com/tranus-english/download-install">TRANUS site</a>
                <p>To begin the process, a window called New Zones Layer is presented with boxes to fill:</p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="img/zones1.jpg">
                    <figcaption>Fig. 2: Zones layer window.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                
                <p>In (1) the scenario tree is displayed as a reference and in (2) the list of sectors in your model is shown.</p>
                <h3>New layer name</h3>
                <p>Give a name to the layer you are generating. In this first example the new layer will be called ‘Total population density 01A’. This is an obligatory field. The program will use this name to generate an auxiliary file in the Project Folder, so that you cannot use special characters that Windows will not accept as part of file names, such as ? * \ etc. </p>
                <h3>Expression</h3>
                <p>The values to be mapped are defined in this expression. The expression may contain:</p>
                <p> - sectors: any sector defined in the model. The list in the box contains the names of all sectors that have been defined. They may be entered into the expression by either typing the name, or by double-clicking in the list</p>
                <p> - operands: valid operands are "+ - * / ( ) < >". They are just typed-in the Expression box. Spaces between sectors and operands are optional</p>
				<p> - constants: any integer or real value</p>
				<p>Note that if the Expression contains a conditional operand < or > the result will be a Boolean map, with zones being either true or false. This implies that there can only be one conditional operand in the Expression.</p>		
                <p>In the example above density is calculated as the sum of all household sectors (HhHigh+HhMed+HhLow), divided by the two land sectors that households may consume (Mixed+ResL).</p> 
                <h3>Scenarios </h3>
                <p>It is also possible to generate a map that relates variables from two different scenarios. For example, you may want a map with the growth of industrial employment from 91A to 16T. Double-click the Indus sector to put it in the Expression box, then select 16T from the Base Scenario pull-down, then select an operand, that may be – or /, and then choose the 91A scenario for the Alternative Scenario pull-down box. The program will subtract 16T – 91A, and this value will be used to generate the map.</p>
				<p>Note that if there is a conditional in Expression, it is not possible to compare two scenarios, and in fact the program will not let you.</p>
                <h3>Field</h3>
                <p>The Field pull-down box displays the list of characteristics associated with each sector, as defined in TRANUS. The map will use the selected field to calculate the Expression and generate the map. The most common field to use is TotProd (Total Production) and Price. If, for example, TotProd is selected, then the Expression will evaluate total production of each sector. In the example above TotProd means 'total number oh households' or 'acres of land'.</p>
                <h3>Some examples:</h3>
                <p>This will produce a map with the total number of industrial jobs for scenario 91A</p>
                <p> - New layer name: Industrial employment 1991</p>
                <p> - Expression: Indus</p>
