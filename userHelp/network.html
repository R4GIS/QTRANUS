                <h1>Network maps</h1>
                <p>This part of the program is used to produce network-based maps from the assignment results generated by the transport model. The only way to be here is to specify in the previous window a valid shapefile with the links representing the network in the model. The user is responsible for a perfect match between the links in the model and those in the shapefile. If, however, there is a link in the model that is not in the shapefile, it will simply not appear in the maps. This may be useful for special links, like external connectors that you don't want to include in your maps.</p>
				<p>In this manual we are using the model of Swindon as an example. This model and all related data may be downloaded from:</p>
				<a href="http://www.tranus.com/tranus-english/download-install">TRANUS site</a>
				<p>To begin the process, a window called New Network Layer is presented with boxes to fill:</p>
                <figure>

                    <figcaption>Network layer window.</figcaption>
                </figure>
				<p>In (1) there are three options. Total means that all operaators found in the model will be included in the map. Operators displays the list of operators found in the model. Routes displays all routes found in the model, including non route-based operators.</p>
                <h3>New layer name</h3>
				<p>Give a name to the layer you are generating, an obligatory field. The program will use this name to generate an auxiliary file in the Project Folder, so that you cannot use special characters that Windows will not accept as part of file names, such as ? * etc.</p>
				<h3>Expression</h3>
				<p>The values to be mapped are defined in this expression. The expression may contain one or several operators or routes added together. Double click the ones you want in the list to put them into the Expression box. Click on 'All' to define the sum of all categories. If Total was selected, you don't have to specify anything in Expression.</p>
				<h3>Scenarios </h3>
				<p>A scenario may be specified, but it is also possible to generate a map that relates values that result from Expression for two different scenarios. For example, you may want a network map with the growth in auto trips from 91A to 16T. The operator relating the two scenarios may be - or /.</p>
				<h3>Variables</h3>		<p>Defines the variable that will be used to calculate Expression and to produce the map. There are several options, such as Demand, Vehicles, Standard vehicles, Level of Service, etc.</p>				<h3>Some examples:</h3>
				<p>This will produce a network map with the total number of passengers for scenario 91A</p>
				<p> - New layer name: Total passengers 1991</p>
				<p> - Expression: nothing (Total)</p>
				<p> - Base Scenario: 91A</p>
				<p> - Alternate Scenario: (nothing)</p>		<p> - Variables: Demand</p>
				<hr>
				<p>This will produce a map with the growth in the number of auto trips from 91A to 11T</p>
				<p> - New layer name: Growth in auto trips from 91A to 11T</p>
				<p> - Expression: (Operators) SOV + HOV</p>
				<p> - Base Scenario: 11T</p>
				<p> - Alternate Scenario: 91A</p>
				<p> - Scenario operand: -</p>
		 		<p> - Variables: Demand</p>
